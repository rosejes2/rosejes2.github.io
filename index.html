	<div id="netherlands">
	<h3>NETHERLANDS</h3>
		<p>Do not sit on the benches on the side of the roads - they look like they are public benches <strong> BUT THEY ARE NOT. THE BELONG TO PEOPLE. IT IS BASICALLY THEIR FRONT PORCH.</strong> </p>

		<p>If there is other outdoor seating at restaurants, just sit down...there is no such thing as a hosts...the people will just let you stand there...</p>

		<p>Trams are the way to go. If you don't scan your little card thing, it will cost you 50 euro. Or they will just kick ya off the train regardless of where you are / where you are going.</p>

		<p>It is not super normal to sit in a coffee shop for hours.</p>

		<p>It is however, normal to drink beer in a business meeting.</p>
   
   </div>

	<div id="norway">

		<h3>NORWAY</h3>
		<p> Honestly - the similarities between Norway and the UP are astounding...</p>

		<p> So expensive...but there are little gas station / parties stores all over that have nice sandwiches that are only like 15 USD that are pretty nice.</p>

		<p> A norwegian krone is <strong>THIRTEEN TO ONE USD. MAKE YOU KNOW THIS AND ARE DOING THE MATH CORRECTLY. </strong> </p>
	</div>

	<div id="denmark">
		<h3>DENMARK</h3>

		<p> This is a nice place to get coffee.</p>
		<p>  This is also a nice place to take pictures of buildings. </p>

		<p> People don't go to bed until <strong>LITERALLY 5AM. </strong> </p>

		<p> Oddly enough, from 5 am to like 8 am there is really nothing going on. Like ya can't even get breakfast. </p>
	</div>

	<div id="italy">

		<h3>ITALY</h3>
		
		<p> <strong>THE SUBWAY IS NOT RELIABLE. THE TRAINS GET DELAYED. </strong>But the buses are definitely the worst..do they even look at the schedule? idk. </p>
		
		<p> It is v hot. You just have to embrace it.</p>

		<p>There are a lot of people that will try to give you flowers. Or little bracelets. <strong>IT IS A PLOY. </strong>do not accept anything. </p>
	
		 <p>The weird fountains that have little spouts of water at about knee high are really safe to drink from...honestly. You can use them as a drinking fountain or to fill up your water bottle. </p>
	</div>

	<div id="germany">

		<h3>GERMANY</h3>

		<p> I didn't have a great time there - I am not a person to ask.  </p>

		<p> Cologne isn't a great place to visit.</p>

		<p> Although there was this <strong>WHOLE</strong> restaurant devoted entirely to cheese fries and so that was pretty nice.</p>
	</div>

	<div id="belgium">
		<h3> BELGIUM</h3>
		<p>Belgian chocolate is surprising much more difficult to find than expected.</p>
		<p>If you google, "best place to buy belgian chocolate in Antwerp, Belgium", the top hit will take you to a place that will sell you chocolate that is WEIRD AS FRICK. DO NOT PURCHASE. </p>
		<p>Also belgian waffles (although much much MUCH easier to find than the chocolate) are just kinda regular waffles????</p>
